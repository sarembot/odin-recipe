        <p>Just look at 'em! You better believe Auntie Barbie was ahead of her time with this one. First brought to the family table in 1957, this age old recipe has truly stood the test of time.</p>
        <p>It's now a staple at the breakfast table in my house, where my imaginary kids and wife really enjoy themselves every morning.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Add lemon juice to a cup of milk. Set aside until milk starts to curdle, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Pour in curdled milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir with a spoon or whisk until the batter is just combined. Add shredded zucchini and mix until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned, about 2 more minutes.</li>
      </ol>
