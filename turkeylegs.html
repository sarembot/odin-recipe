        <span>Just look at those juicy, tender, sexy(?) turkey legs!</span>
        <p>When my Grandpa James fought in the war, there was only one thing that could truly bring with platoon together. Every thursday night he would bless the boys with a couple juicy, tender, and delicious turkey legs made with this multi-generational recipe.</p>
        <p>Grandpa Jimbo was a real trickster, and if it weren't for these great legs, he more than likely would have been dishonourably discharged. Enjoy!</p>
